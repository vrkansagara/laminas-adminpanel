PhlyContact
====

This is a simple ZF2 module implementing a contact form.

Requirements
----

* PHP >= 5.3.3
* Zend Framework 2, beta4 or later, specifically:
    * Zend\Captcha (used for CAPTCHA functionality on the forms)
    * Zend\InputFilter (used for validating the contact form); in turn, uses:
        * Zend\Filter
        * Zend\Uri
        * Zend\Validator
    * Zend\Form (the contact form itself; currently supports beta4 or later)
    * Zend\Mail (for sending the contact emails)
    * Zend\ModuleManager (implements a ZF2 module)
    * Zend\Mvc (provides a controller)
    * Zend\ServiceManager (provides service factories)
    * Zend\View (provides view scripts for the PhpRenderer, and utilizes
      ViewModels in the controller)

Installation
----

Install the module by cloning it into ./vendor/ and enabling it in your
application.config.php file.

You will need to configure the following:

* The CAPTCHA to use, and any options related to it.
* The mail transport to use, and any options related to it.
* If you wish to alter the root path in the site to which the controller will
  resolve, you will need to override the routing configuration.
* If you wish to modify the output, you will need to create alternate templates,
  and configure overrides in your configuration to ensure your versions are
  used.

Sample configuration for use in your application autoload configuration is
provided, demonstrating usage of the ReCaptcha CAPTCHA adapter, the SMTP mail
transport, and setting mail message defaults. This is in
`config\module.phly-contact.local.php`.
